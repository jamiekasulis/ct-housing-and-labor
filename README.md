Basics
- Data comes from two locations: The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Housing Finance Agency
- Employment data is in the thousands, i.e. 1.6 = 1600
- FHFA House Price Index data measures appreciation (increases in price of house)
  - FHFA data also measures house prices relative to 1991, where 1991 = 100
