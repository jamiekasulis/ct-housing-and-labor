Data exploration for an article on CT home appreciation and job recovery

README

Basics
- Data comes from two locations: The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Housing Finance
- Employment data is in the thousands, i.e. 1.6 = 1600
- FHFA House Price Index data measures average appreciation (increases in price of house)
  - FHFA data also measures house prices relative to what they were in 1991 (see notes in notebooks)
